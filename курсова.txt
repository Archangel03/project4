The largest countries in the world by area

Today, there are more than 200 sovereign nations, including all colonies and territories belonging to them,
 which are the waters within 12 miles of a nation's border, groundwater, and airspace over all water and land.
  The area of the largest countries is one of the indicators of economic and political superiority,
   but it is by no means the most important.

   Algeria

   The largest country in Africa - Algeria ranks 10th in the top of the largest countries in the world.
   It is located in the north of Africa and is the largest African state. The largest part of Algeria, about 80%,
    is the Sahara desert. The capital is the city of the same name, Algiers.
     The state is one of the leading countries in terms of gas and oil reserves, but about 20% of people live below the poverty line.

     Kazakhstan

     Russia's closest neighbor, Kazakhstan, is ninth in area in the world.
      This state was part of the Soviet Union until 1991.
       It is located in Central Asia, 36% of its territory is desert, and 35% is steppe.

     Kazakhstan is the only landlocked country among large countries.
      But it has its own Aral Sea and the incomprehensible Lake Balkhash, one part of which is fresh and the other is .
       The country has a rich cultural and historical past.
