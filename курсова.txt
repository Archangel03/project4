The largest countries in the world by area

Today, there are more than 200 sovereign nations, including all colonies and territories belonging to them,
 which are the waters within 12 miles of a nation's border, groundwater, and airspace over all water and land.
  The area of the largest countries is one of the indicators of economic and political superiority,
   but it is by no means the most important.

   It is located in the north of Africa and is the largest African state. The largest part of Algeria, about 80%,
    is the Sahara desert. The capital is the city of the same name, Algiers.
